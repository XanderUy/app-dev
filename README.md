# **How to train your dragon**


==An unfortunate young Viking who wants to hunt dragons ends up becoming an odd friend of a juvenile dragon and discovers that there might be more to the animals than he first thought==. 

You have the heart of a chief… and the soul of a dragon :smile:

**But with love comes loss, son. It’s part of the deal. Sometimes it hurts, but in the end, it’s all worth it. There’s no greater gift than love.**

*"There were dragons when i was a boy"*
